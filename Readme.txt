I took the learning outcomes from this lesson on how to set up the pong game, but I didn't get it entirely working.

I want to use a ball.bounce method, which - simply - reverses the incoming angle.  This works fine on the walls.  Mathematically, it works 
fine on setting the heading from the paddle.  But.  It doesn't work.

I also did not experiment with self.write for the Scoreboard very much, as this is just a module and I can do it some other time.

I think the Turtle module might be - ever so slightly - flakey.  Possibly because it's old (and well established), but I'm doing this
on a very new Windows 11 machine.  Don't know.  As I say:  I've taken the learning outcome, and downloaded the final course solution.  The final course
solution has lots of x and y manipulation, which I really don't like.
